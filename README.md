# 2024-03_breseq_KC-lirL-suppressors
MWS created 2024-03-15 

Analysis of Kate Corey's ∆lirL suppressor mutant genomes, isolated on SDS/EDTA

Scripts are derived from 2023-10-20_breseq (MWS last batch of ∆lirL suppressors)

## Methods from SeqCenter:
Illumina Sequencing Methods
Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared using the tagmentation-based and PCR-based
Illumina DNA Prep kit and custom IDT 10bp unique dual indices (UDI) with a target insert size of
280 bp. No additional DNA fragmentation or size selection steps were performed. Illumina
sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq X Plus sequencer in one or more multiplexed
shared-flow-cell runs, producing 2x151bp paired-end reads. Demultiplexing, quality control and
adapter trimming was performed with bcl-convert1 (v4.2.4). Sequencing statistics are included in
the ‘DNA Sequencing Stats.xlsx’ file.
